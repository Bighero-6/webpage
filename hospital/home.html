<h4 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to our Hospital Management System</h4>
<p>The IT system has revolutionised the field of medicine. In this fast-paced world of medicine, it is a daunting task to manage a multi-speciality hospital. 
A hospital management system (HMS) is a computer or web based system that facilitates managing the functioning of the hospital or any medical set up. 
This system or software will help in making the whole functioning paperless. It integrates all the information regarding patients, doctors, staff, 
hospital administrative details etc. into one software. It has sections for various professionals that make up a hospital.

The doctor can check his schedule and that of other doctors too. This helps a doctor to edit his schedule accordingly. 
It includes list of the available medicines for specific diseases so that the doctor can easily look for an alternative when in need. 
The patient can be given an appointment referring to the doctors schedule.

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Patient information</h4>
<p>New patients can be registered in the system. An electronic medical record system is in-built which stores all the basic and
 medical details of the patient. One can also add a feature to store photos of the patients as identity proof which can also help in medico-legal
 cases of false identities or fraud.
